        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible

    <p>
        Most web browser and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy

        implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your 
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a 
        revised version of this privacy notice.
